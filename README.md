## PRACTICAL JAVASCRIPT COURSE - WATCHANDCODE

### Overview

Practical JavaScript Course provided by Gordon Zhu through [WatchAndCode](https://watchandcode.com/) ðŸŽ’

The course led me through creating a Todo App and breaking down each specs and programming against them.

You will find every version documented as a step-by-step, gradual development of the specified app.

The basics of understanding the UI and UX were taught from version 7.

### Notes ðŸ—’

The skill of refactoring played an important role throughout the course.

Functional programming and working with the DOM and HTML were the main focus. 

'Escaping from the Console' was one of the most interesting parts of the course.
